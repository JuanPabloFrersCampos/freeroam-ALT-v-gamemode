from docker-compose-yaml we specified that we will have two containers:
  one for mongo-express, the other for mongodb.

to start docker we use: docker-compose -f docker-compose-yaml up (assuming that u are in 
  a directory with a .yaml file named like that)
with docker ps we can print all the existing containers
with docker exec -it [container id] bash you may connect to the specified container. 
  mongo is the one that is the one holding the db at the moment.
once inside the container, in order to connect to the DB we use the info specified in docker-compose:
  mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 -u rootuser -p rootpass


Mongo-related:
Once connected to the DB, we can use show dbs to show all the available DBS
